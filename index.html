            <h1>5 Things to Know About Rattlesnakes and Their Babies</h1>
            <p>UA College of Pharmacy | Aug. 6, 2014</p>
            <p>Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state
                known for its rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August,
                making these two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children
                and others at high risk of exposure to rattlesnake bites.</p>
            <div>
                <img src="SnakeBite.jpg" alt="Snake bite on side of child's foot.">
            </div>
            <p>So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
                Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of
                Arizona College of Pharmacy, the center serves the entire state of
                Arizona with the exception of Maricopa County, providing free and
                confidential poison and medication information to callers around the
                clock.</p>
            <p>Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
                from Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a rattler.
                The poison center urges anyone who feels a mysterious sting, pinch or
                bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at 800-222-1222.</p>
            <p>"We will ask a few questions that will help you either identify possible
                snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
                Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
                medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can
                make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams treating
                them."</p>
            <p>The center advises anyone who might come cross paths with rattlesnakes
                to be aware of these five things:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Baby rattlesnakes range in length from 6 to 12 inches and are easily
                    camouflaged by brush and grass.</li>
                <li>Baby rattlesnakes are rattleless until they first shed their skins, so there
                    will be no infamous "chica-chica" sound before they strike.</li>
                <li>Despite their impish size, baby snakes have enough venom to be very
                    dangerous if they bite a human.</li>
                <li>Adult rattlesnakes do not always rattle an audible warning before or
                    while they are biting.</li>
                <li>It's a good idea to call the poison center if you notice an unidentified
                    small cut or wound, even if you feel no pain. With the lack of telltale
                    rattle warning, people can be bitten without knowing what has happened
                    until they notice their symptoms and attribute them to a snakebite.</li>
            </ol>
